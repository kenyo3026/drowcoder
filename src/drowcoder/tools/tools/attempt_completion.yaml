        **[COMPLETION SIGNAL]** Stop the agent iteration loop when you have finished addressing the user's request.

        This agent operates in continuous iteration mode. Call this tool when you have finished addressing the user's request, including:
        - All user-requested tasks have been completed successfully
        - User's question has been fully answered with complete information
        - Determined that the requested task is already done or unnecessary (nothing to do)
        - Found that there is nothing to review, fix, or change
        - Cannot proceed further and have informed the user of the situation
        - Provided your response and now require user input to continue

        **Key Principles:**
        - Not all tasks require tool execution. Some requests can be fully addressed without calling any tools (e.g., answering from existing context, providing explanations). If the user's request is satisfied, call this tool regardless of whether you used tools.
        - You have finished addressing the request when YOU have completed all actions within YOUR capability. If further progress requires user input, decision, or clarification, that means your work is done—call this tool.
        - **CRITICAL REMINDER:** After you provide ANY text response to the user (including answers, information, analysis, or requests for input), immediately evaluate: have I done everything I can do right now? If yes, you MUST call this tool in the SAME response. Do NOT wait for user confirmation or continue iterating without purpose. Call this tool immediately after your response.

        **IMPORTANT:** The agent will continue iterating indefinitely until this tool is called (up to max_iterations).
        Simply providing a text summary is NOT sufficient to stop - you must call this tool explicitly after giving your response.
