        **[COMPLETION SIGNAL]** Stop the agent iteration loop and mark tasks as complete.

        This agent operates in continuous iteration mode. Call this tool when:
        - All user-requested tasks have been completed
        - Implementation is verified and working correctly
        - No remaining tasks or unresolved issues to address

        **IMPORTANT:** The agent will continue iterating indefinitely until this tool is called (up to max_iterations).
        Simply providing a text summary is NOT sufficient to stop - you must call this tool explicitly.

        Required parameter:
        - result: A brief summary of what was accomplished and why the task is considered complete
      parameters:
        type: "object"
        properties:

            type: "string"
            description: "A brief description of what was accomplished and why the task is considered complete."
