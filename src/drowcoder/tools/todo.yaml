        Load and retrieve TODO list from a JSON file.

  #     parameters:
  #       type: object

  #         checkpoint_path:

  #             Path to the TODO JSON file to load from.
  #             Must be a valid file path containing TODO data saved by update_todos function.
  #       required:
  #         - checkpoint_path
  # NOTE: get_todos function is intentionally commented out from tool configuration
  # DESIGN DECISION: The get_todos function requires checkpoint_path as a mandatory parameter,
  # but we want the system to automatically provide this path rather than exposing it to users.
  # The checkpoint_path should be managed internally by the agent using checkpoint.todos.path
  # to ensure consistency and prevent users from accessing arbitrary file paths.
  # This function remains available in the codebase for internal use but is not exposed as a tool.
